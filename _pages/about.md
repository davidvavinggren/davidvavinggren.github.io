I graduated from [Linköping University](https://liu.se/) in 2024 with a bachelor's degree in *Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering*, and a master's degree in *Data Science and Machine Intelligence*.

In January 2025, I started my journey as a PhD student at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/). Specifically, I am employed by the [Division of Systems and Control](https://www.uu.se/en/department/information-technology/research/control-and-dynamical-systems/division-of-systems-and-control) at the [Department of Information Technology](https://www.uu.se/en/department/information-technology). 

I am supervised by [Antonio Hôrta Ribeiro](https://antonior92.github.io/), and co-supervised [André Teixeira](https://www.andre-teixeira.eu/) and [Dave Zachariah](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N13-1398). My research lies in the intersection between statistics and machine learning, where i currently work on adversarial training for linear models.
